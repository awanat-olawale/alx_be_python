## 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise

### Objective: 

To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.

### Task Description:

You are required to complete a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers. The script should do the following:

Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.

When executed, your script should print the following (assuming number1 = 10 and number2 = 5):

**Here is the outcome:**

*Addition of 10 and 5 is 15*

*Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5*

*Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50*

## 1. Simple Interest Calculator

### Objective: 

Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

### Task Description:

Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T)

**Expected Output:**

When executed, your script should print the simple interest calculated with the provided values. For principal = 1000, rate = 0.05, and time = 3, the output should be:

*The simple interest is: 150.0*

## 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

### Objective: 

Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

### Task Description:

For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

**Expected Output:**

When executed, your script, with the provided values (length = 10 and width = 5), should print the area of the rectangle:

*The area of the rectangle is: 50*

## 3. Convert Hours to Seconds

### Objective: 

Demonstrate understanding of variable assignments and arithmetic operations by converting a given number of hours into seconds.

### Task Description:

For this task, write a Python script that converts a specific number of hours into seconds. This task reinforces the concept of arithmetic operations within a practical context

**Expected Output:**

Given the value hours = 2, your script should output: *2 hour(s) is 7200 seconds.*

## 4. User Input Age Calculator

### Objective: 

Practice receiving user input in Python and perform a simple arithmetic operation to calculate the user’s age in a future year.

### Task Description:

Create a Python script that asks the user for their current age and then calculates how old they will be in a specific future year. This task introduces handling user input and reinforces arithmetic operations.

**Expected outcome:**

If the user inputs 30 when prompted for their current age, the output should be: *In 2050, you will be 57 years old.*

## 5. Personal Finance Calculator

### Objective: 

Use user input, variables, and arithmetic operations to calculate and provide feedback on a user’s monthly savings and potential future savings without applying conditional statements.

### Task Description:

You will create a script named finance_calculator.py. This script will calculate the user’s monthly savings based on inputted monthly income and expenses. It will then project these savings over a year, assuming a fixed interest rate, to demonstrate compound interest’s effect on savings

Use the simplified formula for annual savings projection: (Projected Savings = Monthly Savings * 12 + (Monthly Savings * 12 * 0.05)).
Output Results:

Display the user’s monthly savings.
Display the projected annual savings after including interest.
Example Interaction:

Enter your monthly income: 5000
Enter your total monthly expenses: 4000
*Your monthly savings are $1000.*

*Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: $12600.*
