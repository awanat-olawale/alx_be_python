## 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise

### Objective: 

To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.

### Task Description:

You are required to complete a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers. The script should do the following:

Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.

When executed, your script should print the following (assuming number1 = 10 and number2 = 5):

**Here is the outcome:**

*Addition of 10 and 5 is 15*

*Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5*

*Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50*

## 1. Simple Interest Calculator

### Objective: 

Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

### Task Description:

Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T)

**Expected Output:**

When executed, your script should print the simple interest calculated with the provided values. For principal = 1000, rate = 0.05, and time = 3, the output should be:

*The simple interest is: 150.0*

## 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

### Objective: 

Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

### Task Description:

For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

**Expected Output:**

When executed, your script, with the provided values (length = 10 and width = 5), should print the area of the rectangle:

*The area of the rectangle is: 50*
